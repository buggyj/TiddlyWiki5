title: FilterOperator: sortcs
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The ''sortcs'' filter operator sorts the current list case sensitively (upper and lower case letters are considered different). Preceding the operator with `!` reverses the sort order.

For example:

|!Filter String |!Description |
|`one two Three four +[sortcs[]]` |Returns `Three`, `four`, `one`, `two` |

See also [[FilterOperator: sort]], [[FilterOperator: nsort]] and [[FilterOperator: nsortcs]].
