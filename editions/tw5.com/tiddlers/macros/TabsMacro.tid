title: TabsMacro
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The tabs macro displays a list of tiddlers as a tab control. The user can switch between tabs by clicking on them. The tabs are labelled with the title of the corresponding tiddler, unless there is a `caption` field present in which case it is used instead.

By default the tab control arranges the tabs horizontally with the content underneath. You can also choose to have the tabs arranged vertically by passing the class `tw-vertical`.
